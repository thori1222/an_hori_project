If taking the derivative of the position data to get the velocity of the car, the obtained result is noisy. Therefore, EKF might be a better solution. 

This package calculates the EKF for estimating the position, velocity and the yaw rate of the vehicle based on the measurements of position and yaw rate. 

6DoF vehicle model is considered.
